first we sell the stock after buying it only at first we need to buy so for the first index we will take it as buy and not as sell
so we will check from second index - first index then check if it is max or not and update the max 
we need to make a track of minimum number so that it will be easy to minus from the minimum buying stock for the particular selling price and if it is greater than max 
we will update the max and return the max finally....



import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Solution{
    public static int maximumProfit(ArrayList<Integer> prices){
        int max = 0;
        int min = prices.get(0);
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int tempMax = prices.get(i) - min;
            if(tempMax > 0){
                if(max < tempMax){
                    max = tempMax;
                }
            }
            min = Math.min(min,prices.get(i));
        }
        return max;
    }
}
